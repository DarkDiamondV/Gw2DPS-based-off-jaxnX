# GW2DPS
Based on JaxnX, modified by Kozzy & Tyrox

What makes it legal : It does not offend the Terms of Service of Guild Wars 2. It does not read from game memory. Instead it uses Computer Vision techniques to read out numbers presented in the combat log by taking screenshots of the chat block periodically, converting pixels of the image into numbers and using the converted numbers for dmg / dps calculation. The whole process happens in real time.

Settings for correct measuring : Options/Graphics Options: Interface Size=Normal, Resolution=Windowed Fullscreen, Chatbox/options: Text Size=Medium, Disable Timestamps, Chatbox/Combat page/options: enable only : Outgoing Buff Damage+Outgoing Damage+Outgoing Mitigated Damage. Make sure your combat log has more then 16+ lines and always visible.
